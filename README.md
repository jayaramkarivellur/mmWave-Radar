**mmWaveKit** is an open-source development toolkit for designing and simulating components of mmWave systems—including waveguides, transmission lines, antennas, and radar hardware—using Python and open standards.

---

## 🔍 What is mmWaveKit?

mmWaveKit enables engineers and researchers to:

- Design and simulate **waveguide structures** (rectangular, circular, etc.)
- Model **transmission lines** (microstrip, CPW, stripline)
- Simulate and plot **antenna patterns** (array, patch, horn)
- Prototype **radar architectures**, including:
  - FMCW waveforms
  - Target reflection modeling
  - Range-Doppler mapping

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 📐 **Waveguide & transmission line design** tools
- 📶 **Antenna modeling**: gain, radiation patterns, efficiency
- 🧠 **Radar prototyping**: signal chain, range/velocity simulation
- 📊 **Visualization**: 2D/3D plots of EM structures and signals
- 🔌 Modular design with export support to HFSS, CST, and KiCAD

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `NumPy`, `SciPy` – numerical and signal processing
- `Matplotlib`, `Plotly` – for rich plotting and layout visualization
- `PyVista` / `VTK` – optional for 3D geometry rendering
- `scikit-rf` – for S-parameter handling and RF components
- Custom Python modules for EM computation and radar DSP
